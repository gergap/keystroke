Keystroke install instructions:
==============================

Requirements:
------------

* gcc/g++
* cmake 2.8 or higher
* Qt 4.x

Quick build:
-----------

# default build options
./build.sh

# developer build
./build.sh dev

Building manually:
-----------------

If you know CMake it should be straight forward for you.
Here are the necessary steps:

mkdir bld
cd bld
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

Note: The install step makes the executable owned by root and sets the SETUID
bit. This is necessary, because the applications needs root privileges to open
the keyboard device. After the device was opened it drops this root privileges
for security reasons.

Running:
-------

/usr/local/bin/keystroke-gui

After starting the tool you should already see all keystrokes popping up at the
bottom of the screen. Also a systray icon is shown, which you can use to open
the configuration dialog.

The systray icon can also be used to quit the application.

Shortcuts:
---------

META-F10: toggles the enabled state of the keygrabber. This way you can disable
          the tool temporary, e.g. when you are entering a password.
